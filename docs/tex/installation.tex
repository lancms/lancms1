\chapter{Installation}

There are two ways of installation LANCMS, one is the official releases from launchpad.net/lancms, the other is from the code repository on Bazaar.
If you are not an experienced Linux/UNIX sysadmin, you probably want to download the official releases. They probably aren't very up2date, but they should work.
The trunk-code in Bazaar is the most updated code, and we try to always keep it working (since that is the version we're running ourself).
