\chapter{After installation - a quick intro to using lancms}

After installing the software, log in as \lstinline!globaladmin / admin! and
create your first event in globaladmin. After creating the event you should go
back to globaladmin and set it as public, so that normal users may find it.

Since lancms has support for multiple events and multiple URLs, you have to go
to \lstinline!globaladmin -> change global options! and set default eventID
for the hostname you're using for your installation of lancms.
'1' is the default id, no event, event. The first event you create get id '2'.
