\section{Globaladmin}

Globaladmin is the module where you changes that affect the entire lancms
installation. You can create and change events, view the logs and modify
users.

Only users with global admin-rights can see \lstinline!globaladmin!. This
right can normally not be given out, but there are two ways of giving it to
more than the first "globaladmin"-user:
\begin{itemize}
\item By finding the user you want to give global admin-rights to in MySQL
(phpmyadmin or other tool) and changing the field \lstinline!globaladmin! to
'1' from '0'.
\item By putting the following in your config.php or OverrideConfig.php:
\lstinline;$globalaccess[] = 'globaladmin';. Afterwards you have to create an
accessgroup in an event and give it the globaladmin-right. You should for
security-reasons remove the globalaccess-line from your config afterwards.
\end{itemize}

Events can have two operating modes: public and private. If the event is
public, anyone can see it in the eventlist (in the menu). If it's private, you
have to be given permission to see it (or have global admin-rights). To give
someone access to a private event, set that event as active and go to
\lstinline!Attendee-access!. That will give you a list of all access-groups in
all events and you can press \lstinline!allow access! to give the members of
that group access to the event.
